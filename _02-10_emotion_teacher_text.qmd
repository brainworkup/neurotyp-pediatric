To obtain information regarding Jessica’s behavior and emotional functioning in the home and at school, her mother and first-grade teacher, Shana Bellaros, completed the appropriate rating scales from the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children–Second Edition (BASC-2). On the BASC-2, which compares a student’s social, emotional, and behavioral functioning in a variety of areas to other children in the same age range, Jessica’s mother and her teacher indicated that Jessica exhibits clinically significant and at-risk levels of attention problems, respectively. Both her mother and her teacher indicated that Jessica is almost always easily distracted and has a short attention span. Ms. Bellaros reported problems with hyperactivity falling in the clinically significant range while her mother indicated that she is at-risk for concerns in these areas. Ms. Bellaros indicated that Jessica almost always has trouble staying seated. Both respondents reported problems with poor self-control and impulsivity as occurring on an often basis. In the area of adaptive functioning, Jessica’s mother and teacher indicated that she is at-risk for problems with functional communication. Her teacher reported that she is “never” able to describe her feelings accurately, and both respondents indicated that she is sometimes unclear when presenting ideas.
