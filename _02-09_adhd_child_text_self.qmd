## Sleep scales

Based on the information provided in the PDF file and the additional details from the web search, here is a summary and interpretation of the patient's scores on the PROMIS sleep assessment measures:

The patient, {{( include patient )}} Gibbons, a 12-year-old male, completed the Parent Proxy Sleep Disturbance – Short Form 8A and the Parent Proxy Sleep-Related Impairment – Short Form 8A. 

On the Sleep Disturbance measure, {{( include patient )}} scored a raw score of 8, which corresponds to a T-score of 39. This T-score falls within the normal limits, indicating that his sleep disturbance is within the expected range for his age and gender. [^1] [^2]

However, on the Sleep-Related Impairment measure, {{( include patient )}} scored a raw score of 24, which corresponds to a T-score of 68. This T-score falls in the "Severe" range, suggesting that his sleep-related impairment is significantly impacting his daily functioning and well-being. [^2] [^3]

The detailed item responses indicate that {{( include patient )}} is experiencing issues with daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and problems during the day due to poor sleep. These findings warrant further clinical evaluation and potential intervention to address the sleep-related impairment and its impact on his daily life. [^4] [^5]
