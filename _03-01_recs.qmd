# RECOMMENDATIONS {#sec-recs}

## Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare

- {{< var first_name >}} should receive interventions to enhance concentration, manage anxiety, and improve emotional understanding. This includes social skills training, psychoeducational interventions for self-image improvement, and monitoring for signs of internalization or externalization of problems.

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To develop strategies for improving executive functions and addressing self-esteem issues.

- **Occupational Therapy:** To enhance graphomotor skills for academic tasks and daily activities.

- **Cognitive Training:** Techniques to boost working memory and attention, along with strategies to improve focus.

- **Speech-Language Therapy:** Working with a speech-language pathologist can help improve memory skills, particularly for verbal material.

- **Psychoeducation:** To empower Biggie with self-awareness and enable {{< var his_her >}} to advocate for {{< var his_her >}} needs in various settings.

- Additional support is recommended in areas like attentional function, processing speed, and cognitive efficiency. This can be achieved through occupational therapy, the use of organizational tools, and creating a distraction-free environment.

- Treatment options for ADHD should include behavioral techniques, stimulant medication consideration, environmental organization, and long-term perspective maintenance. Medical treatment discussion with a child and adolescent psychiatrist could be beneficial.

- Additional support is suggested in areas like auditory comprehension and complex figure copying. This can be accomplished through speech-language pathology and occupational therapy respectively. Use of visual aids and breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps can also be helpful.

## Recommendations for School

- **Accommodated Testing:** Extended time accommodations are recommended due to relative weakness in processing speed and academic fluency.

- **Calculator Use:** Please consider allowing Biggie to utilize a calculator for class assignments and examinations as {{< var he_she >}} progresses in the mathematics curriculum.

- Biggie should receive additional support in mathematics through:
  - Individual or small group tutoring.
  - Visual aids and hands-on activities.
  - Technology-based learning tools.
  - Real-life math scenarios practice.
  - Extra time for math-related tasks.

- Support within the educational setting, such as an individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 Plan, to address attentional/executive challenges. Academic accommodations should include extended time on tests, reduced copying from the board, or a note-taker to offset slower psychomotor speed and attentional challenges.

- **Adaptive Writing Tools:** Use of ergonomic pens or pencil grips for better control and fewer errors.

- **Graphomotor Exercises:** Drawing or tracing exercises for improved fine motor coordination.

- **Extra Time for Written Tasks:** Additional time for tasks requiring writing to compensate for slower graphomotor speed.

- **Technology Use:** Keyboard or voice-to-text software use to mitigate graphomotor weaknesses' effect on academic performance.

- Tutoring or teaching assistance is recommended for improving {{< var his_her >}} sentence level writing fluency and overall academic fluency in reading, math, and writing. 

- A supportive environment at home and school involving clear instructions, task breakdown into smaller steps, and praise for efforts and achievements.

## Recommendations for Home

- **Mnemonic Devices:** Use of mnemonic strategies like acronyms or visual images for memory retention.

- **Organizational Strategies:** Note-taking, list-making, and visual schedules can provide external memory support.

- **Task Simplification:** Break down complex information into smaller, manageable parts for effective processing and remembering.

- **Repeated Exposure and Practice:** Repeated exposure to material and additional practice are beneficial due to below-average learning efficiency.

- **Set Reminders:** Use calendars, alarms, written notes, and lists for task reminders.

- **Mindfulness Training:** Technique to ignore distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand, aiding in cognitive control.

## Recommendations for Follow-Up Evaluation

- A follow-up assessment in 12-18 months is suggested to measure progress and assess the interventions' impact, unless urgent concerns arise. Continuous monitoring and reassessment are vital to adjust support as {{< var first_name >}} develops and {{< var his_her >}} needs change.

## Other

Recommendations
1. Given the fact that her verbal abilities are an area of relative weakness and she exhibits executive functioning deficits, a comprehensive evaluation of {{< var first_name >}}'s cognitive and academic abilities is necessary to rule out the possibility of learning difficulties and ensure that she is provided with appropriate services within the educational setting.
2. Based on behavioral observations of difficulty with recall, especially of verbal material (an ability closely aligned with academic success), a comprehensive assessment of memory functions with an instrument such as the Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL) may be useful in instructional planning.
3. A multimodal approach to treating attention problems is generally recommended, including environmental modifications, counseling, and medication. {{< var his_her >}}'s parents should consult with her pediatrician about the potential pros and cons of medical management for her attention disorders.
4. To assist with problems with attention and organization, the following classroom accommodations are recommended:

a. Jessica should continue to be given preferential seating, near the teacher and away from doors and windows to help her attend to lessons. She should be surrounded by peers with good classroom behavior, and placed in a work area with limited distractions.
b. Because sitting in a chair is difficult for her, interactive learning with manipulatives will work well for Jessica. Provide Jessica with both visual aids and verbal instruction to increase the likelihood that she is attending to directions.
c. Given Jessica's attentional issues, it will be important to make sure that her attention is focused before presenting information. She may have trouble sustaining her attention and effort for any extended period and would benefit from occasional breaks. When Jessica's attention has waned, she often becomes unaware of what is going on around her. As a result, when teachers refocus her attention it is important that they also redirect her to task.
d. Avoid multistep directions whenever possible. Provide Jessica with simple, one-step directions, then monitor to make sure that she is completing the task correctly. Provide demonstrations when possible.
e. Due to her problems with attention, Jessica should take tests in a quiet room, free from distractions.
f. Given Jessica's attention deficits, effort should be made to avoid singling her out or embarrassing her for not paying attention. Rather, she could be "alerted" in advance when she is going to be called on in school, so that she can prepare herself.
g. To assist with organization, it would be helpful to have someone meet with Jessica at the end of the school day to review homework assignments, including making sure she knows the steps involved, where to begin, and what materials are needed.
