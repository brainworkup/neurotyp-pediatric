This affects {{< var his_her >}} ability to quickly retrieve and articulate words related to specific topics, which might be noticeable in conversational speech or specific tasks like brainstorming. {{< var his_her_cap >}} Below Average score in phonemic fluency indicates difficulties in generating words that start with a specific letter.
