# This is an example ".prompt" file
# It is used to define and reuse prompts within Continue
# Each .prompt file can be accessed by typing "@prompts" in the Chat input

# A prompt file consists of two parts:
# 1. Everything above the "---" is YAML. Here you can set "temperature", "description", and other options
# 2. Everything below the "---" is the prompt body

# If you do not want to set any options, you do not need to include the "---"

# In the body, you can reference:
# 1. Files, using either absolute or relative paths (based on the workspace root)
  # @_02-02_academics.qmd
  # @src/test/test.py
  # @/Users/me/Desktop/my-project/src/test/test.py
# 2. URLs, for example
  # @https://example.com
# 3. Context providers, for example
  # @currentFile
  # @os
  # @repo-map

# Academic Performance Summary Instructions

## Purpose

Create a concise, professional summary of the patient's academic performance based on neurocognitive assessment results.

## Format Requirements

- Write a single paragraph in third-person, past tense
- Focus on real-world functional implications rather than raw test scores
- Highlight significant strengths and weaknesses, with less emphasis on average-range scores
- Capitalize performance descriptors (e.g., "Below Average," "Average," "Above Average")
- Omit specific test scores unless presenting meaningful percentile information (e.g., "Above Average, higher than 95% of the general population")

## Content Focus

- Translate assessment results into practical academic implications
- Interpret findings in terms of everyday functioning
- Emphasize how performance relates to real-world academic settings

## Style Guidelines

- Professional clinical tone
- Concise language
- Grammatically correct
- Avoid simply restating test names and their standard descriptions

Harry exhibited predominantly Average academic functioning across most domains.
Reading abilities, including comprehension and fluency, were sufficiently
developed to support independent classroom learning and completion of
grade-level assignments. Mathematical competencies, encompassing both
calculation and practical problem-solving, were similarly intact, enabling Harry
to handle typical classroom mathematics demands. Oral language skills also fell
within the Average range, suggesting adequate verbal participation and
comprehension during classroom discussions. However, written expression emerged
as a notable area of relative weakness, falling in the Low Average range.
Specifically, Harry demonstrated difficulties with phonic decoding fluency and
spelling accuracy, which may impact written communication efficiency. These
challenges could manifest in practical academic contexts through slower writing
speed, increased proofreading demands, and potential reluctance to engage in
writing-intensive tasks. While Harry's overall academic profile remained solidly
Average, targeted support for written expression skills would likely benefit
academic performance in writing-heavy subjects and assignments.
